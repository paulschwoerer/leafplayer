## Installation

### With Docker

Use the following command to get up and running quickly. Don't forget to replace `supersecret` with a secure, random string and adjust the `/path/to/your/music` directory.

```sh
docker run -d \
  -e "APP_SECRET=supersecret" \
  -v "/path/to/your/music:/music:ro" \
  -v "leafplayer-storage:/var/lib/leafplayer" \
  -p "127.0.0.1:3000:3000" \
  --name leafplayer \
  paulschwoerer/leafplayer
```

You should now see the Leafplayer web interface by navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Without Docker (Linux only)

You need to have a working install of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/). Development is done with Node 16, however Node 14 should work as well.

```sh
# check your node version
node --version
```

After that, grab the latest Leafplayer release from the [releases page](https://github.com/paulschwoerer/leafplayer/releases) and extract it into a directory of your choice, for example `/opt/leafplayer`.

```sh
# specify the version to use
LP_VERSION="1.0.0"

# specify the Leafplayer directory
LP_DIRECTORY="/opt/leafplayer"

# specify a user to run Leafplayer as
LP_USER="lpuser"

# add the user
adduser "$LP_USER"

# create the Leafplayer directory
sudo mkdir "$LP_DIRECTORY"

# download the specified release
wget -P /tmp "https://github.com/paulschwoerer/leafplayer/releases/download/v$LP_VERSION/leafplayer-v$LP_VERSION.zip"

# unzip release
sudo unzip -q "/tmp/leafplayer-v$LP_VERSION.zip" -d "$LP_DIRECTORY"

# give the Leafplayer user permission to write to the directory
sudo chown -R $LP_USER "$LP_DIRECTORY"

# install dependencies
cd "$LP_DIRECTORY" && npm install

# finally, remove downloaded file
rm "/tmp/leafplayer-v$LP_VERSION.zip"
```

Leafplayer will use `/var/lib/leafplayer` as its storage directory. Make sure it exists and that the user account, which will run Leafplayer, owns it.

```sh
sudo mkdir /var/lib/leafplayer

chown "$LP_USER" /var/lib/leafplayer
```

Finally, start the server. Don't forget to replace `supersecret` with a secure, random string.

```sh
cd "$LP_DIRECTORY"

NODE_ENV=production APP_SECRET=supersecret node main.js serve
```

You should now see the Leafplayer web interface by navigating to [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### Reverse Proxy

Note, that the setup above will only allow you to access your Leafplayer instance from your local machine. When deploying a live instance, you should setup a reverse proxy to handle TLS. See for example [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/) for a simple-to-use solution.

```sh
caddy reverse-proxy --from music.yourdomain.home --to localhost:3000
```

## Usage

If you followed the docker instructions, prefix the following commands as follows.

```sh
sudo docker exec leafplayer node main.js ...
```

To create an initial admin account, run the following command.

```sh
node main.js users:add \
  --username admin \
  --password supersecret
```

You can now add your music directory and start a music scan.

```sh
node main.js library:dir --add /music

node main.js library:scan
```
